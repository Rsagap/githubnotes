Github Notes

What git is used for:
Keep track of changes to the code

Create a file -> add a line -> remove a line

Synchronize code between different people.

Test changes to the code without losing the original.

Revert back to original version of code.

For Mac

Steps

1. Create a new repository at github.com/new

2. Once you create empty repository clone to local machine with
			git clone <url>

3. $ cd Desktop/Softwarica\ Codes/
   $ git clone https://github.com/Saagar-afk/githubnotes.git
   $ cd githubnotes

4. Create a new file inside githubnotes "hello.html"

5. Commiting the code(Tanking snapshots of the current version of a file)
		git add <filename>
		keep track of <filename> file, such that when i commit it next time the file will be added.

	why have multiple steps:
		Such that i my woring with very large file and wanna save changes made to 3 files only, instread of commiting all the file, i wanna say these are the only 3 files i wanna commit and have made changes.
