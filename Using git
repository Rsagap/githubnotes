What git is used for:
Keep track of changes to the code

Create a file -> add a line -> remove a line

Synchronize code between different people.

Test changes to the code without losing the original.

Revert back to original version of code.

For Mac

Steps

1. Create a new repository at github.com/new

2. Once you create empty repository clone to local machine with
			git clone <url>

3. $ cd Desktop/Softwarica\ Codes/
   $ git clone https://github.com/Saagar-afk/githubnotes.git
   $ cd githubnotes

4. Create a new file inside githubnotes "hello.html"

5. Commiting the code(Tanking snapshots of the current version of a file)
		git add <filename>
		keep track of <filename> file, such that when i commit it next time the file will be added.

	why have multiple steps:
		Such that i my woring with very large file and wanna save changes made to 3 files only, instread of commiting all the file, i wanna say these are the only 3 files i wanna commit and have made changes.

	$ git add hello.html

	$ git commit -m "my first commit"


6. If you notice in your github the file is not there on github


	These changes were only saved to my local copy, inorder to make changes to the github

	$ git status

7. $ git push
		whatever changes were made will be pushed to the github

8. Commit all of the file 
	$ git commit -am "add extra lines"
	a- all of the files
	m-message


9. $git pull

	Maybe the version on github is more updated than i have, in that case i want to download the newest version of the file



line added from giithub

	Merge Conflicts

		pulling github changed code to locally commited code in same line 


10. $ git log
	
	History of all the logs

11. $ git reset
		
		$ git reset --hard <commit>
		$ git reset --hard origin/master

		reset your local version to githubs version

12. Branching
	
	master - stable version from where the branches form
		eg:
			feature(branch)
	head - where you are currently at

	$ git branch
		which branch i am currently on have * at the front(head), and displayes all the branches


		$ git checkout 
			(to change branches)
		$ git checkout -b styles
				-b Create a new branch
		$ git checkout main
			(Change to main branch)


13. $git merge extras
		merge whatever is in extras branch to the main branch
